<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/tech-splash.jpg')" alt="Intergiro Developer Portal">

Moving money abroad can be an expensive business. Wherever you sit in the value chain, you’ll likely be charged high rates by banks and providers alike. While many charge extra to integrate and take payments, we develop a fully bespoke solution with you to ensure you’re all set to join the world of international money transfers.

Integrate with us to ensure you get full visibility of transfer and exchange rates, payment fees and no hidden markups. With our transparent transfers you can be 100% certain you're getting the best rate for your business, wherever and however you make or take payments.

Get instant access to 38 currencies in over 180 countries worldwide. By connecting to our local payment network, you'll get clear of expensive charges passed on to you for international payments. Pay and get paid like a local for a pain-free experience.

We build seamless customer interactions, powered by APIs. Our solutions directly integrate with your ecosystem to meet your users wherever they are. Integrating with us is hardware-agnostic and fully white-labelled so your brand stays strong and your customers stay happy.

If Integrate with Intergiro to create your own banking services, from making and taking payments via API to issuing your own branded cards, is the solution your business is looking for tell us! You can get in touch with us through [Integrate](https://intergiro.com/integrate) and share your story.

## Register your business account

To start using our platform, you must sign up for a [Intergiro business account](https://business.intergiro.com/onboarding). The onboarding process is fast and simple but also help us cover necessities e.g. compliance, but also to get to know your business. You'll also get an SEPA ([Single Euro Payments Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area)) business account which may be used to receive future revenue. During the onboarding process you can always reach out to our support for any type of inquiries.

## Start developing

When you've sent us your [declaration of interest](https://intergiro.com/integrate), we'll contact you and set up an first information meeting, for you to tell us more about your business model. You'll also get more information about on how to plug into our platform to build a customised payment solution fully tailored to your business needs. Once ready to start development we'll book an kick-off meeting.

The kick-off meeting will get you and your team ready to Integrate our platform to fit your business needs. During the meeting you'll receive an starter pack which will get you access to our staging environment and much more...
