# Introduction

There are three different methods to perform 3D Secure.
### [Automated](./automated.html)
 If you want to perform 3D Secure in one automated flow, follow the steps in the [Automated](./automated.html) section. This method provides an endpoint that returns html that when you render performes the whole 3D flow. This method is suitable for those who <em>do not</em> need control in the 3DS process and want an easy integration. 
### [Interactive](./interactive.html)
 If you want control of what happens between the steps in the 3D cycle, follow the steps in the [Interactive](./interactive.html) section. This method is suitable for those who need <em>some</em> control in the 3DS process and want an easy integration. 
### [Controlled](./controlled.html)
 If you want full control of the 3D flow, follow the steps in the [Controlled](./controlled.html) section.
