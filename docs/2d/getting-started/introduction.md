Intergiro 2d API allows to automate your own business processes. For example, you can view accounts, transactions and make payments without manual effort in the WebUI interfaces, which saves time, and reduces costs and errors

We've partnered with major European traditional banking players as well as fintech infrastructure providers to form a package of different financial products to offer to our end customers via an API.

Our 2d product provides API access to Direct Banking Service.
Today these solutions include:
 - Accounts
 - Payments
 - Identification & Verification
 - Compliance

In the future we will also be adding Card Acquiring, FX, Lending etc.
