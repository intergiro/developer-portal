# Intergiro 2D


Integrate business banking into your existing systems and processes through our 2D API.
<br>

As an Intergiro customer, you can use 2D API to automate your own business processes. For example, you can view accounts, transactions, make payments without manual effort in the WebUI interfaces, which saves time, and reduces costs and errors.

To get started using the 2D API, check the user guide.

You can also reference the API specification on Github.

## Register your business account

The onboarding process is fast and simple but also help us cover necessities e.g. compliance, but also to get to know your business. You'll also get an SEPA ([Single Euro Payments Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area)) business account which may be used to receive future revenue. During the onboarding process you can always reach out to our support for any type of inquiries.
