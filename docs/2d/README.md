# Intergiro 2d


Integrate business banking into your existing systems and processes through our 2d API.
<br>

As an Intergiro customer, you can use our 2d API to automate your own business processes. For example, you can view accounts, transactions, make payments without manual effort, which saves time, and reduces costs and errors.

To get started using the 2d API, check the user guide.

You can also reference the API specification here.
