# API

## Authorization
In order to create an [Authorization](./reference.html#authorization), first send a request with the body of the request set as an [Authorization creatable](./reference.html#authorization).

Example Authorization request:
``` {1}
POST /v1/authorization

Host: merchant.intergiro.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

{
	number: "a_unique_identifier",
	amount: 23,
	currency: "EUR",
	card: {
		pan: "4111111111111111",
		expires: [2, 22],
		csc: "987"
	}
}
```

Example Response:

``` {1}
HTTP 200 OK

{
	id: "1234567890123456",
	number: "a_unique_identifier",
	merchant: "testtest",
	amount: 23,
	currency: "EUR",
	history: [],
	change: [],
	capture: [],
	refund: [],
	created: "2021-04-01T09:00:00.000Z",
	reference: "12341234",
	card: {
		csc: "matched",
		expires: [2, 22],
		iin: "411111",
		last4: "1111",
		scheme: "visa",
		type: "debit",
	},
}
```
Sometimes [verification](./reference.html#verification) will be required. this important field to look for is the `error: "verification required"`. 
Example of a verification required response:
```{1,15}

    "type": "verification required",

        "condition": "authorization.amount>15 !(authorization.verification:verified) !(authorization.recurring:subsequent)"
      }
    ]
  },
  "error": "verification required"
}
```
